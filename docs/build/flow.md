# Why Flow

Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain designed to be the foundation for a new generation of games, apps, and [digital assets] that power them. It is based on a unique, [multi-role architecture], and designed to [scale without sharding], allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.  It also supports full [EVM] equivalence.

## What Makes Flow Unique

- **Multi-role architecture:** Flow's node architecture allows the network to scale to serve billions of users without sharding or reducing the decentralization of consensus.
- **Resource-oriented programming:** Smart contracts on Flow are natively written in [Cadence], an easier and safer programming language for crypto assets and apps.
- **Developer ergonomics:** This network is designed to maximize developer productivity. Examples range from upgradeable smart contracts and built-in logging support to the Flow Emulator.
- **Consumer onboarding:** Flow was designed for mainstream consumers, with payment onramps catalyzing a safe and low-friction path from fiat to crypto.
- **EVM Equivalence**: The [Cadence] VM is powerful enough to allow other VMs to run inside of it, almost like a Docker Container.  The first one integrated in this way is [EVM], because of the comfort of many builders with Solidity and the EVM RPC API.



- **True Fast Finality**: Unlike 
- **Gasless Transactions**: 
- **VM Token Bridge**: Assets can be bridged between Flow Cadence and Flow EVM easily with the VM token bridge.  
- **Native VRF**: Flow supports 
- **Native Account Abstraction**: The Flow has protocol native [account abstraction].

## App Development

The [Flow App Quickstart](./guides/flow-app-quickstart.md) covers the Flow core concepts, including:

- **App Client:** The app client is the interface through which users interact with your app. Web and mobile applications are typical examples of app clients.
- **Smart Contract:** A smart contract is a collection of code deployed to a permanent location on the blockchain that defines the core logic for a dApp.
- **User Account:** A user account is a record on the blockchain that stores the digital assets owned by a single user.
- **Transaction:** A transaction is a code submitted to the blockchain that mutates the state of one or more user accounts and smart contracts.
- **User Wallet:** A user wallet is software or hardware that controls access to a user's account on the blockchain.
- **Script:** A script is a request made to the blockchain that returns information about the state of your dApp's smart contracts.
- **Flow Client Library (FCL):** The Flow Client Library is a framework that provides a standard interface to connect client applications and user wallets.

## Core Contracts

The Flow blockchain implements core functionality using its own smart contract language, [Cadence](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/language/). The core functionality is split into a set of contracts, so-called [core contracts](../build/core-contracts/index.md):

- **Fungible Token:** The FungibleToken contract implements the Fungible Token Standard. It is the second contract ever deployed on Flow.
- **Flow Token:** The FlowToken contract defines the FLOW network token.
- **Flow Fees:** The FlowFees contract is where all the collected flow fees are gathered.
- **Service Account:** tracks transaction fees and deployment permissions and provides convenient methods for Flow Token operations.
- **Staking Table:** The FlowIDTableStaking contract is the central table that manages staked nodes, delegation, and rewards.
- **Epoch Contract:** The FlowEpoch contract is the state machine that manages Epoch phases and emits service events.

## FLOW Token

The [FLOW](../build/core-contracts/03-flow-token.md) token is the native currency for the Flow network. Developers and users can use FLOW to transact on the network. Developers can integrate FLOW directly into their apps for peer-to-peer payments, service charges, or consumer rewards. FLOW can be held, transferred, or transacted peer-to-peer.

## Technical Background

- The [Flow Technical Primer](https://www.onflow.org/primer) is a great place to start to understand how Flow works.
- The [Three technical whitepapers](https://www.onflow.org/technical-paper) cover the unique innovation behind the Flow blockchain network in-depth.

## Tokenomics

- To understand more about Flow's Token Economics, and the **FLOW token**, you can read the [Flow Token Economics](https://www.onflow.org/flow-token-economics) guide.
- FLOW tokens are Flow's native Fungible Token. To learn more about how to work with them in your applications, go [here](../build/core-contracts/03-flow-token.md).
